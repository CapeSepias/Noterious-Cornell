# Noterious Cornell
Manage and create notes using [Cornell note taking method](https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b).

The app itself is a way to put into practice all programming languages, concepts and tools I was introduced to in [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). I really, really recommend it. It offers great value for money.

I built it on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Front-end is created mainly using [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templating. The latter I plan to rewrite using React (public commitment).

The app is available [here](https://noterious-cornell.herokuapp.com). It was deployed using [Heroku](www.heroku.com) and [mongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

If you have any suggestions (especially regarding code improvement), just let me know.
